pivot points in fortran 77 example
ChatGPT

Pivot points are commonly used in numerical algorithms for solving systems of linear equations, particularly in matrix operations like Gaussian elimination. Here's an example in Fortran 77 to illustrate how pivot points might be used in a basic context. This example will focus on a simple matrix operation using partial pivoting.

Fortran 77 does not have built-in matrix operations, so you'll need to handle arrays and indexing manually. Letâ€™s consider a scenario where you want to perform row operations on a 3x3 matrix to find the pivot points:

fortran

      PROGRAM PIVOTEXAMPLE
      INTEGER I, J, K, MAX, N, TEMP, INDEX
      PARAMETER (N=3)
      DOUBLE PRECISION A(N, N), B(N)

      DATA A /1.0D0, 2.0D0, 3.0D0, 
     &     4.0D0, 5.0D0, 6.0D0,
     &     7.0D0, 8.0D0, 10.0D0/
      DATA B /6.0D0, 15.0D0, 25.0D0/

      PRINT *, 'Initial matrix A and vector B'
      DO I = 1, N
        PRINT 10, (A(I, J), J=1, N), B(I)
10    FORMAT (3F8.2, F8.2)
      END DO

      ! Forward elimination process with partial pivoting
      DO K = 1, N-1
        ! Finding the pivot row
        MAX = K
        DO I = K+1, N
          IF (ABS(A(I, K)) .GT. ABS(A(MAX, K))) THEN
            MAX = I
          END IF
        END DO

        ! Swapping the rows if necessary
        IF (MAX .NE. K) THEN
          DO J = K, N
            TEMP = A(K, J)
            A(K, J) = A(MAX, J)
            A(MAX, J) = TEMP
          END DO
          TEMP = B(K)
          B(K) = B(MAX)
          B(MAX) = TEMP
        END IF

        ! Elimination step
        DO I = K+1, N
          TEMP = A(I, K) / A(K, K)
          B(I) = B(I) - TEMP * B(K)
          DO J = K+1, N
            A(I, J) = A(I, J) - TEMP * A(K, J)
          END DO
          A(I, K) = 0.0D0
        END DO
      END DO

      PRINT *, 'Modified matrix A and vector B after pivoting'
      DO I = 1, N
        PRINT 10, (A(I, J), J=1, N), B(I)
      END DO

      END

This program first initializes a 3x3 matrix A and a vector B that might represent a system of linear equations. It then performs partial pivoting during the forward elimination phase of Gaussian elimination. Note that:

    The pivot is selected as the largest absolute value in the current column to be reduced (K column).
    Rows are swapped to move the pivot into the diagonal position.
    The system is then modified using standard row operations.

This example uses simple I/O routines for demonstration and debugging. Adjustments might be needed depending on your specific requirements and the precision of the data you're working with.
